/**
 * Guards against the failure mode that has repeatedly wiped working features out of this repo:
 * an edit that was supposed to change part of a file instead replaced the whole file with a stub.
 *
 * It really happened. Commit 1582e92 landed lib/supabase/queries.ts on main as the single word
 * "PLACEHOLDER" — 1969 lines gone — and deployed. Across this repo and its sibling there are 13
 * commits where a source file was replaced by two lines or fewer, each followed by a "fix:
 * restore ..." commit days later, after an owner noticed a feature had vanished.
 *
 * Nothing caught them because nothing ran before a merge. These tests do.
 *
 * If a failure here is INTENTIONAL (you really did delete or shrink a file), run
 *     node scripts/feature-manifest.mjs
 * and commit the updated manifest, so the removal shows up in the diff as a deliberate choice.
