# QA Report — Aggarwal Jewellers (aggarwal-jwellers.vercel.app)

**Tested:** 16 Jul 2026 · production deploy `47b5c27` · Chrome (real browser, end-to-end)
**Tester:** Claude (acting QA) · Method: every reachable module exercised with realistic sample data; every money figure cross-checked across surfaces (bill ↔ dashboard ↔ udhaar ↔ cashbook ↔ customer ledger).

---

## 1. Executive summary

The core lifecycle — catalogue → storefront → checkout (COD + voucher) → fulfillment →
tracking → POS billing → customer directory → udhaar → dealer portal — **works end-to-end**.
Stock movements are exact (12 → 8 across four sales, verified on the trade portal), the GST-aware
"single source of truth" money formula holds on the header revenue, udhaar and sales register,
and both auth gates (owner console, trade portal) correctly redirect anonymous visitors.

QA found **2 critical money bugs** (both silent — the UI showed success while the books went
wrong), plus one high price-consistency issue and a tail of mediums/minors. All critical/high
code fixes are written and included in this batch; two need one-line-ish migrations (0053, 0054).

## 2. Bugs found

### 🔴 Critical

| # | Bug | Root cause | Status |
|---|-----|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **7 consecutive Vercel deploys failed for 17 h** — nothing shipped after the fulfillment pack | `.catch()` on a Supabase query builder (not a Promise) + a missing import; esbuild smoke checks don't run tsc | ✅ fixed & deployed (`47b5c27`); full `tsc --noEmit` now mandatory pre-push |
| 2 | **No payment could ever be recorded** — COD collect-on-delivery, the invoice "Record a payment" panel and udhaar party receive all failed silently | `record_payment` / `record_party_payment` insert into `ledger` via `CASE WHEN … 'cash' ELSE 'bank'` — a text expression Postgres won't implicitly cast to the `ledger_kind` enum (bare literals coerce; CASE doesn't). Vercel log: `column "kind" is of type ledger_kind but expression is of type text` | ✅ **migration 0053** (recreates both RPCs with `::ledger_kind` cast) — **run in Supabase** |
| 3 | **Every POS bill recorded as fully-paid walk-in with no salesperson** — partial payments (₹200, ₹100) vanished; customer link and employee attribution lost; cashbook legacy book (₹1,100) disagrees with the method ledger (₹300, which is correct) | The post-billing `orders.update()` includes `buyer_gstin/buyer_address/buyer_state` — columns that **exist in no migration** (hand-added in the reference project's DB only). One unknown column ⇒ Supabase discards the whole update payload, silently | ✅ **migration 0054** (adds the 3 columns) + code hardened: money-critical fields now retried separately and failures logged loudly — **run in Supabase** |

### 🟠 High

| # | Bug | Detail | Status |
|---|-----|--------|--------|
| 4 | **JS ↔ SQL retail price drift** | Customer sees ₹559 (+₹50 ship = ₹609) at checkout; server bills ₹550 (rate ₹688 vs UI ₹690). Same root as the 4 pre-existing failing unit tests (JS `computePrices` vs SQL `bd_price` constants) | 🔴 **open** — needs a dedicated reconciliation pass; every symptom traced to this one root |
| 5 | Website Orders queue rendered empty (real order invisible) | `customers.address` column never existed → embedded join 400-failed the whole query; also silently broke checkout customer inserts | ✅ fixed (migration 0052 + resilient fallback) — verified live |
| 6 | **Logged-in dealers cannot send quote requests** ("Name and phone are required") | `getWholesaleSession()` didn't return `phone`; the logged-in form hides the phone field, so validation always failed | ✅ fixed (session now carries phone; action prefers non-empty values) |

### 🟡 Medium

| # | Bug | Detail | Status |
|---|-----|--------|--------|
| 7 | Dashboard **channel donut / weekly trend / category & top-product cards count cancelled orders** and use raw totals | Donut said ₹4,450 while the (correct) header said ₹2,195 — a cancelled ₹2,255 POS bill was included; figures also ignored GST mode & returns | ✅ fixed (`getDashboardAnalytics` + `getChannelReport`: dead orders excluded, GST-aware grand) |
| 8 | **Sales-return picker offers cancelled bills** | A1D2CC92 (cancelled, ₹2,255) selectable for return | ✅ fixed (`getRecentOrders` excludes dead statuses) |
| 9 | Quick-add photo never became the storefront image ("PHOTO COMING SOON" cards) | Raw uploads excluded by the AI-image-only rule | ✅ fixed earlier in this pass — owner's photo becomes cover |
| 10 | Payment RPC failures were **silent** in three server actions | `rpc()` errors ignored → UI showed success | ✅ fixed (logged + early-return) |

### 🟢 Minor / cosmetic — ALL FIXED (17 Jul polish pack)

| # | Item | Fix |
|---|------|-----|
| 11 | Stale "AggarwalDIVA" in BD1000's stored AI title/description | ✅ **migration 0056** scrubs stored content in place (idempotent, dedupes double-brand titles) |
| 12 | Voucher totals showed fractional rupees ("₹553.1"), Place-order button didn't refresh after voucher | ✅ discounts now whole-rupee at the single server source (preview AND application); button shows the discounted total |
| 13 | Customers-page "Outstanding" showed "—" while parties owed | ✅ column now merges open-bill dues (same source as Udhaar) + ledger balance; advances shown in green |
| 14 | "Approved Retailers · 0 pending" ignored dealer applications | ✅ counts wholesale customers (approved/pending) instead of the empty legacy `retailers` table; header revenue also made GST-aware here |
| 15 | Hindi console gaps on dashboard hero/section headings | ✅ 6 new dictionary keys wired ("दिखा रहे हैं", "चैनल के हिसाब से बिक्री", …) |
| 16 | Returns picker labels hard to identify | ✅ now shows invoice no. + date + customer + amount |

## 4. Sample data created (left in place, per instructions)

| Type | Records |
|------|---------|
| Categories | Necklaces, Earrings, Bangles |
| Product | **Mahika Necklace** · BD1000 · base ₹250 · stock now 8 · published, photo uploaded |
| Website orders | `05037F5D` QA Test Customer (9999988888) · COD ₹550 · **delivered** · unpaid (bug #2 evidence) — settle with "Record a payment" after 0053 · `C5CAF3C3` Priya Sharma (QA) (8888877777) · COD ₹545 (voucher WELCOME10 −₹55 + ship ₹50) · status New |
| POS bills | `AJ/26-27/0001` & `0002` Ramesh Kumar (QA) (9876512345) · ₹550 each — show "Paid" though ₹200/₹100 were tendered (bug #3 evidence; method ledger holds the true ₹300) |
| Cancelled order | `A1D2CC92` ₹2,255 (COD-cap guard test from earlier session) — correctly excluded from revenue/udhaar |
| Customers | QA Test Customer, Priya Sharma (QA), Ramesh Kumar (QA), **Verma Fashion Store (QA)** (wholesale, Meerut, 7777766666, approved, code `88SBXQ`) |
| Employee | Sanjay (QA Staff) |
| Voucher | WELCOME10 (live, used 1×) |
| Quote request | Verma: BD1000 ×50 + oxidised jhumka ×100 (lands in /admin/quotes after this deploy) |

To clean the two mis-booked POS bills after 0053+0054: either cancel `AJ/26-27/0001`/`0002`
(reverses fully) and re-ring them, or leave them — they're QA artefacts, clearly named.

## 5. Suggestions (non-bug)

1. **Kill the price drift at the root (bug #4)** before go-live: generate the SQL pricing
   function from `lib/pricing.ts` constants (or vice versa) and make the 4 failing tests the
   contract; until then customers occasionally see ₹9-class discrepancies.
2. Add a health-check page (`/admin/health` exists per 0045/0046 views) to the sidebar so
   the owner can see book-vs-ledger drift like the ₹300 vs ₹1,100 mismatch instantly.
3. The two "phantom column" incidents (customers.address, orders.buyer_*) both came from the
   reference DB having hand-applied DDL. Worth one sweep comparing every column the code
   touches against migrations (the QA batch fixed all found today).
4. Regenerate BD1000's AI listing to purge the last "AggarwalDIVA" string.
5. Env tasks still open: `BUSINESS_UPI_VPA` (scan-to-pay QR), `STAFF_WHATSAPP_NUMBER`,
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` after domain purchase, GA4 id; delete legacy `BLYTHE_BANK_*` overrides.

## 6. Fix batch shipped with this report

**Code:** `app/actions/orders.ts` (hardened POS money update + logging), `app/actions/payments.ts`
(RPC error logging), `app/actions/quotes.ts` + `lib/wholesale.ts` (dealer quote fix),
`lib/supabase/queries.ts` (analytics dead-order/GST fix, returns picker filter),
`components/admin/BarcodeSheet.tsx` (client price-code scheme `A·7{wholesale}7·{retail}·51`).
**Migrations:** `0053_ledger_kind_cast.sql`, `0054_orders_buyer_columns.sql` — **applied 16 Jul**.

## 7. Post-fix verification (deploy 9e7d135 + 0053/0054 — 16 Jul evening) — ALL PASS ✅

| Flow | Result |
|------|--------|
| Label price code | ✅ BD1000 prints `A7275755951` (A · 7-275-7 · 559 · 51) per client spec |
| Invoice "Record a payment" (bill 05037F5D, ₹550 cash) | ✅ bill flips to **Paid**, panel disappears |
| COD deliver auto-collect (C5CAF3C3: accept → dispatch → deliver) | ✅ **Paid ₹545** recorded, courier ₹50 itemised |
| POS partial (AJ/26-27/0004: ₹150 of ₹550, Ramesh, sold-by Sanjay) | ✅ badge **Partial**, ₹150 paid / ₹400 due, customer linked |
| Employee attribution | ✅ Sanjay: 1 bill · ₹550 sales · ₹150 collected (exact) |
| Udhaar party receive (Ramesh ₹400 cash) | ✅ allocated oldest-first; receivables now **₹0, all parties settled** |
| Dealer quote (as Verma, logged in) | ✅ sent; lands in /admin/quotes with dealer name+phone auto-attached |
| Dashboard analytics | ✅ donut ₹2,745 = Retail ₹1,095 (2) + POS ₹1,650 (3); cancelled ₹2,255 excluded |

**Remaining open:** #4 JS↔SQL price drift (needs dedicated pass) · minors #11–16 (cosmetic/UX).
