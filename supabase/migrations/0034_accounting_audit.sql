-- Aggarwal Jewellers — 0034: Accounting & ERP audit fixes (applied to production 2026-07-01).
-- Idempotent. Keeps the repo in sync with the live database.

-- 1) Sales returns now record a STOCK MOVEMENT (every inventory change must have a source).
--    Previously record_sales_return changed products.qty directly with no stock_adjustments row,
--    so returns never showed in Stock Movement / the Product Ledger and drifted inventory.

-- 2) Read-only VALIDATION views — surface accounting/inventory inconsistencies automatically.

select p.id as product_id, p.sku, p.name, p.qty as on_hand,

create or replace view public.v_overpaid_orders as
select id, invoice_no, customer_name, total, amount_paid, amount_paid - total as overpaid

create or replace view public.v_accounting_health as
select
  (select count(*) from v_inventory_reconciliation) as inventory_drift_products,
  (select count(*) from v_overpaid_orders) as overpaid_orders,
  (select count(*) from products where coalesce(qty,0) < 0) as negative_stock,
  (select count(*) from stock_adjustments where ref_id is null and kind in ('sale','purchase','return','estimate')) as movements_without_source,
  (select coalesce(sum(greatest(0, total-amount_paid)),0) from orders where status not in ('cancelled','void')) as receivable_paise,
  (select coalesce(sum(p.total),0) - coalesce((select sum(amount) from supplier_payments),0) from purchases p) as payable_paise;

-- 3) One-time reconciliation: post an 'audit' movement wherever stock was added historically
--    without a movement record, so the ledger sums to physical on-hand. Stock is NOT changed.
insert into stock_adjustments(product_id, sku, delta, kind, source, reason, created_by, created_at)
select product_id, sku, drift, 'audit', 'Opening reconciliation',
       'Auto-reconciled stock ledger to physical on-hand (accounting audit)', 'system', now()
from public.v_inventory_reconciliation where drift <> 0;

-- 4) Guard: recorded payment can never exceed the bill total (change is not revenue).
update orders set amount_paid = total, pay_cash = least(coalesce(pay_cash,0), total)
where coalesce(amount_paid,0) > coalesce(total,0);

create or replace function public.cap_amount_paid() returns trigger language plpgsql as $$
begin
  if new.total is not null and coalesce(new.amount_paid,0) > new.total then
    new.amount_paid := new.total;

drop trigger if exists trg_cap_amount_paid on orders;
create trigger trg_cap_amount_paid before insert or update on orders
  for each row execute function public.cap_amount_paid();
