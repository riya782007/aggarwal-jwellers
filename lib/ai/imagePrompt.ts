  return `Use the attached image as the EXACT product reference. Generate a professional, editorial-grade e-commerce photograph of a model wearing this exact piece of jewelry.

NON-NEGOTIABLE — PRODUCT FIDELITY:
The jewelry in the output must be IDENTICAL to the reference image — same metal color and finish, same gemstone cut, color, size, and placement, same engravings, links, clasps, and proportions. Do not redesign, restyle, embellish, or "improve" the piece. Treat it as a real product that must match what the customer will receive.

NON-NEGOTIABLE — ABSOLUTELY NO TEXT:
The image must contain ZERO text of any kind. No words, no letters, no numbers, no captions, no labels, no logos, no watermarks, no brand names, no price tags, no signatures, no stamps, no UI elements, no borders with writing. The background, clothing, jewelry, and every surface must be completely free of any written or typographic elements. If any text would normally appear, leave that area clean and blank.

SUBJECT: ${subject}.
SHOT TYPE: ${shot} — framed so the jewelry is the clear hero and sharply in focus.
STYLING & WARDROBE: minimal, neutral clothing (soft beige, white, or muted tone) that does not compete with the jewelry. No other jewelry or accessories in frame unless they match the piece. No printed text, slogans, or graphics on the clothing.
LIGHTING: soft, diffused studio lighting with gentle directional highlights to make metal catch light and gemstones sparkle, no harsh shadows, no blown-out highlights on the piece. Color-accurate so the metal and stones read true.
BACKGROUND & MOOD: ${background}. Calm, aspirational, trustworthy — luxury brand feel. The background must be plain and free of any text, signage, or writing.
TECHNICAL: photorealistic, shot on a 85mm lens look, shallow depth of field with the jewelry tack-sharp, high resolution, natural skin texture (real pores, no plastic airbrushing), professional color grading.
OUTPUT: ${aspectNote}. A clean photograph with NO text, NO watermark, NO logo, and NO graphic overlays anywhere.`;
