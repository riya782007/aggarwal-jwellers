If in doubt, copy the reference exactly. It must match what the customer physically receives. NO HALLUCINATION: never invent, guess or add any stone, motif, drop, colour or element that is not clearly visible in the reference — reproduce ONLY what is actually there.

MAXIMUM SHARPNESS & DETAIL (critical — the owner wants every cut visible):
Render the jewellery ultra-sharp, crisp and high-resolution so EACH individual stone, bead, facet, cut and engraving is clearly defined and separated — tack-sharp, no blur, no softening, no smudging or melting of detail on the piece. Fine details must read crisply, like a high-end macro product photograph.

No words, no letters, no numbers, no captions, no labels, no logos, no watermarks, no brand names, no price tags, no signatures, no stamps, no UI elements, no borders with writing. The background, clothing, jewelry, and every surface must be completely free of any written or typographic elements. If any text would normally appear, leave that area clean and blank.

SUBJECT (a display stand for the jewellery only — her face is NOT the subject and must not be featured): ${subject}.${western ?

THE JEWELLERY IS THE HERO (CRITICAL):
The piece must be the brightest, sharpest, most eye-catching element in the entire frame — prominent, large in the composition, and tack-sharp. Expose and light specifically FOR the jewellery so the metal gleams with crisp specular highlights and every stone/bead sparkles and reads vivid and true. The piece must visibly POP against the skin and clothing with clear contrast and separation — it should be the first thing the eye lands on. Do not let the model, hair, or background draw attention away from the jewellery.

STYLING & WARDROBE: minimal, neutral clothing (soft beige, ivory, blush, or muted tone) with a simple neckline that showcases the piece. No competing jewelry or accessories. No printed text, slogans, or graphics on the clothing.
LIGHTING: bright, clean, high-key studio beauty lighting — soft and flattering on the skin so the model reads luminous, with crisp directional key light on the jewellery to make metal catch light and gemstones sparkle. No dark, dim, or muddy tones; no heavy shadows on the face; no blown-out highlights on the piece. Colour-accurate so metal and stones read true and rich.
BACKGROUND & MOOD: ${background}. Calm, aspirational, trustworthy — luxury Indian brand feel. The background must be plain, bright and free of any text, signage, or writing.
TECHNICAL: photorealistic, shot on a 85mm lens look, shallow depth of field with the jewelry tack-sharp, high resolution, natural skin texture (real pores, no plastic airbrushing), professional color grading.
OUTPUT FRAMING: Render the final image in ${aspectNote}.
OUTPUT: A clean photograph with NO text, NO watermark, NO logo, and NO graphic overlays anywhere.`;
