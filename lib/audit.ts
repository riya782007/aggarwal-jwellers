 * Notifications → Activity feed can show "Deleted Rajwadi Necklace (AJ1004)",
 * "Hidden AJ1010 from store", "Price changed for AJ1007", etc.
 *
 * Best-effort by design: logging must NEVER block or fail the real action, so
 * every call is wrapped and swallows its own errors. Fire-and-forget friendly.
